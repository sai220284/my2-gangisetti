# PHP Script Execution Time Counter

 

Below is a PHP code snippet that can be used to measure and display the execution time of a script in seconds. This snippet is sourced from [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/php/count-script-excecution-time/).

 

```php
<?php
$execution_time = microtime(); // Start counting

// Your code

$execution_time = microtime() - $execution_time;
printf('It took %.5f sec', $execution_time);

 ```
 

In this section , I've enclosed the PHP code snippet in code fencing (```php) to format it as code. Additionally, I've added a quick-link to the source at CSS-Tricks for reference.
