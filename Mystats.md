### SAI TEJA GANGISETTI

I've spent my whole two-year career working in software development, and thanks to my dedication to critical thinking and attention to detail, I am now a senior software engineer in Mainframe Technology. I'm a skilled team leader who normally oversees 4 engineers at once, and I'm passionate about processes.

Prior to taking on my current position, I worked at Mainframe First as a software engineer and programmer. I've already had every other position in this industry, so I have a thorough understanding of what it takes to manage a project successfully. As a CTO, I want to transition into a database administration position since I know it will help me develop my leadership abilities.
